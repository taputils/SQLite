# SQLite

A simple and powerful Android app to run, test, and manage SQLite queries — no internet required.

## About

**SQLite** by [@taputils](https://github.com/taputils) is a terminal-style SQL runner app built for Android. It allows developers and learners to experiment with SQLite syntax, create and manage database tables, and test queries in real time — all from their mobile device.

The app supports two main modes:

### 🧾 Script Mode
- Write, save, and execute entire SQLite scripts.
- Organize your SQL files for reuse.
- Useful for more complex database workflows.

### 🍔 Sandwich Mode
- Execute single-line SQLite queries on the fly.
- Great for quick testing or learning syntax.
- Results are displayed immediately below your input.
